	<p>Hello World, I'm Damon - A software engineer pursuing the passion of building and belief that the world can be fully-automated.</p>
	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>In my career-long-experience as a full-stack web developer, I have learned to appreciate designing simplicity into systems. The most challenging problems I have faced as an engineer are typically the result of complexity being introduced into systems. This is different however from developing in a straightforward manner, which does not inherently mean simple. One could install a third party dependency to handle sorting of complex objects, which might be straightforward, but that dependency may have thousands of lines of code to understand in order to know what is going wrong when a bug occurs. I always try to engineer in a way that supports simplicity in the design, implementation, and maintenance.</p>
